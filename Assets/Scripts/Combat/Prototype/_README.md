No generics here. Sorry in advance for making a *third* alternative.

This is *not* the proposal.
But it still should follow good practices.
I will trial them here, and add them to the programming bible after.

The goal of this is to be *very* direct about what something is. No generics for hiding behavior.
The design is still modular, but in the sense that there is clear purpose and separation, that allows for replacement.
The actual method to replace behavior is not here however.
